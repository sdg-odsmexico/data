Neither does this indicator capture the quality of care received.</p>\n<p>Data collection and data interpretation in many countries is challenged by lack of guidelines, standardization of professional titles and functions of the health care provider, and in some countries by task-shifting.

These would differ from the global figures, which are typically based on survey data collected at the household level. </p>\n<p>In terms of survey data, some survey reports may present a total percentage of births attended by a skilled health professional that does not conform to the SDG definition (e.g., total includes provider that is not considered skilled, such as a community health worker). In that case, the proportion of childbirths by a physician, nurse, or a midwife are totalled, consulted with the country and included in the global database as the SDG estimate. </p>\n<p>In some countries where the indicator on skilled health personnel is not actively reported, birth in a health facility (institutional births) is used as a proxy indicator. This is frequent in countries in the Latin America region, in European and Central Asian regions, where the proportion of births attended by health professionals is very high. Nonetheless, it should be noted that institutional births may underestimate the percentage of births assisted by skilled health professionals, particularly in cases were home births - assisted by skilled health professionals - are prevalent. </p>","OTHER_DOC__GLOBAL":"<p><strong>URL: </strong><a href=\"https://data.unicef.org/topic/maternal-health/delivery-care/\" target=\"_blank\"><strong><u>https://data.unicef.org/topic/maternal-health/delivery-care/#</u></strong></a><strong> </strong> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>References:</strong> </p>\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <ol>\n      <li>Definition of skilled health personnel providing care during childbirth 2018 joint statement by WHO, UNFPA, UNICEF, ICM, ICN, FIGO and IPA. https://www.who.int/reproductivehealth/publications/statement-competent-mnh-professionals/en/</li>\n      <li>Joint UNICEF/WHO database of skilled health personnel, based on population-based national household survey data and routine health systems. https://data.unicef.org/topic/maternal-health/delivery-care/#. </li>\n      <li>United Nations Population Division, World Population Prospects. https://population.un.org/wpp/Download/Standard/Population/.</li>\n    </ol>\n  </li>\n</ul>","target_number":"3.1","goal_number":"3","indicator_sort_order":"03-01-02"}
